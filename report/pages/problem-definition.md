In modern times, consumers increasingly rely on web-based purchases. However, the capabilities of small business enterprise and even startups are not yet equipped to affordably provide functional, user-friendly e-commerce solutions to meet their customers' demands. What is needed is a well-designed solution accessible to enterprises, which is scalable and offers an intuitive end-user experience-easy to shop with-and at the same time is easily administered for product and order management.

This project focuses on the development of a prototype for an e-commerce web application, which should be able to simulate a retail environment online. It addresses issues like product management and shopping cart challenges. The prototype would be in a position to show the ways in which small businesses could refine their operations by providing them with a well-organized product catalog, ease of use of a shopping cart, and flexibility in an administrative interface.
